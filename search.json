    "text": "(Jones and Cheung 2018)\nSuch vulnerability assessments recognize that a species’ vulnerability to climate change depends on an interaction between its intrinsic biological or ecological characteristics (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) and the extrinsic threats or stimuli (exposure and hazard) (Figure 1). In this study, we adopted the climate vulnerability and risk assessment framework used by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Field et al. (2014).\nSensitivity of a species, referred to here as the susceptibility to impacts from climate change, is affected by species’ biological and ecological traits. Species’ sensitivity may be moderated by their\nadaptive capacity, which reflects a species’ ability to adapt and thus cope with, or avoid, the impacts of climate change.\nAs the unit of assessment is an individual species, we consider a species’ ability to shift in distribution to avoid or minimize negative impacts from changing habitat conditions on its viability as an adaptive response to climate change. Specifically, in this study, we focus on characteristics that determine a species ability to show this response, within its current distribution. Thus, the spatial response of a distribution shift may itself be influenced by adaptive characteristics included here. The combination of a species’ sensitivity and (lack of) adaptive capacity determines its vulnerability to climate change. Ultimately, the risk of impacts of climate change on the species is determined by its vulnerability as well as the potential occurrence of climate-related ocean changes (i.e., hazards such as warming, ocean acidification) and the degree of exposure to such event (i.e., exposure) (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Framework for assessing climate change vulnerability and risk adopted by the fifth assessment report of the IPCC (Field et al., 2014)",

    "text": "(Zacharias and Gregr 2005)\n\nDefinitions of Sensitivity and Vulnerability\nSensitivity and vulnerability are central concepts in the protection of marine ecosystems, yet the marine literature provides few explicit definitions (Holt et al. 1997; Tyler-Walters & Jackson 1999). Consequently, their meaning often relies on the context in which they are used. To avoid context-dependent definitions of these terms, we took the following value-neutral approach to defining sensitivity and vulnerability.\nIt is axiomatic that all marine features have either evolved (in the case of biotic features) or been formed (in the case of abiotic features) within a certain range of environmental conditions. We define stress as a deviation of these environmental conditions beyond the expected range. Sensitivity is the degree to which marine features respond to such stress. Specifically, sensitivity is measured using one or more indicators (of species, communities, and habitats) that respond to one or more natural or anthropogenic stressors. These responses are potentially nonlinear and are likely to include interactions between stressors. In this context, sensitivity does not inherently assume the characteristics of fragility or intolerance with which it is often associated. There is no implied judgement that an increased association between the indicator and the stressor reduces a feature’s probability of persistence. Nevertheless, as exposure to a chronic perturbation or stress increases, the persistence of that feature is diminished.\nVulnerability is the probability that a feature will be exposed to a stressor to which it is sensitive. In other words, vulnerability is the likelihood of exposure to a relevant external stress factor (sensu Tyler-Walters & Jackson 1999), combined in some way with the exposure (duration, magnitude, rate of change) to that stress.\nSubsumed under the concepts of sensitivity and vulnerability are the concepts of stability and fragility. Although these terms lack general consensus on their definitions, Holling (1986) states that\nstability is the tendency of a system to attain or retain an equilibrium condition of steady state or stable oscillation.\nResilience is the ability of a system to maintain its structure and behavioral patterns when subjected to disturbance. A feature, therefore, that is stable or resilient in the presence of a stressor is not sensitive to that stress as we have defined it. Also, a feature that is sensitive to a stressor for which it has a low probability of exposure is not vulnerable.\nOur definitions of sensitivity and vulnerability are consistent with the ESI approach used for oil spill response and countermeasures (Gundlach & Hayes 1978). Under the ESI approach a resource is defined as sensitive to oil if it would be harmed by physical contact with oil or concentrations of oil in water. A resource is defined as vulnerable if it is likely that it would be exposed to oil or high concentrations of oil for long enough periods for the oil to affect it. Vulnerability in terms of oil spills on shorelines, therefore, is a function of duration of exposure, recognizing that certain resources are vulnerable to oiling regardless of duration.\nOur definition of a VMA, which incorporates the concepts of sensitivity and vulnerability, is a geographically definable area containing features that are sensitive to natural and/or anthropogenic stressors they are likely to encounter. Features may be biotic (species, communities) or abiotic (habitats) structures or processes.\nWe caution against equating VMAs as we have defined them (and their sensitivity and vulnerability components) with terms such as priority areas, biodiversity hotspots, critical habitat, environmental significance, and areas of interest, which are often used to identify areas of special concern or areas requiring management attention. Although certain VMAs may also represent priority areas or hotspots, depending on how these terms are defined and applied, an area may be sensitive or vulnerable but not meet criteria commonly used (e.g., species diversity) to identify these areas. In addition, although our definitions of sensitivity and vulnerability may contribute to measures or assessments of ecological (or ecosystem) integrity, these concepts are again different. Lastly, identification of an area as sensitive or vulnerable does not suggest that an area should be recommended as a marine protected area (MPA) or marine reserve or that MPAs are the only management tool applicable to the management and conservation of VMAs.",

For example,\nsensitivity is analogous to the ecological concept of resistance,\nexposure is analogous to reactivity, and\nadaptivity is analogous to resilience (14–16).\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyce, Daniel G., Derek P.
