    "text": "This Marine Sensitivity (MS) project of BOEM seeks to assess the sensitivity of marine species to offshore energy development, whether oil & gas or wind. By combining the best available species distributions with known species sensitivities we can map out areas of the ocean that are most vulnerable to human activities. This information can be used to inform decisions about where to place energy infrastructure and/or implement mitigations to minimize impacts on the marine environment.\nThis is a process, not a product. Information is imperfect, especially given the large expanse of US waters. Distributions and abundance of species change, modified increasingly by climate change and human activities. Knowledge on species sensitivities continues to expand with more research. And finally the methods for both modeling and distributing all this information continue to improve. We aim to provide a transparent and reproducible process that can be regularly updated as new data and methods become available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n\n  %% nodes\n  ta[(\"&lt;a href='https://docs.ropensci.org/taxize/articles/datasources.html'&gt;taxonomic&lt;br&gt;authority&lt;/a&gt;\")]:::in\n  sd(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(vector|raster)\"):::in\n  sdm(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(+taxaid)\"):::out\n  sdmt(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;distributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(aligned rasters)\"):::out\n  sdmte(\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;vulnerability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;raster\"):::out\n  ct(\"&lt;b&gt;topology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;to share&lt;br&gt;\"):::in\n  st[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(tables)\"]]:::in\n  stm[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(+ taxaid)\"]]:::out\n  stmc[[\"species&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;(equation ready)\"]]:::out\n  eq[[\"&lt;b&gt;equation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;of sensitivities per species\"]]:::in\n  m[/\"&lt;b&gt;match&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;taxa\"/]:::fxn\n  t[/\"&lt;b&gt;transform&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;to rasters\"/]:::fxn\n  c[/\"&lt;b&gt;clean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;tables\"/]:::fxn\n  e[/\"&lt;b&gt;evaluate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;rescale(&sum;eq&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;)\"/]:::fxn\n\n  %% edges\n  ta   --&gt; m\n  sd   --&gt; m\n  st   --&gt; m\n  m    --&gt; sdm\n  m    --&gt; stm\n  sdm  --&gt; t\n  ct   --&gt; t\n  t    --&gt; sdmt\n  stm  --&gt; c\n  c    --&gt; stmc\n  eq   --&gt; e\n  sdmt --&gt; e\n  stmc --&gt; e\n  e    --&gt; sdmte\n\n  %% Legend\n  in(input):::in\n  fxn[/process/]:::fxn\n  out(output):::out\n  subgraph Legend\n    in\n    fxn\n    out\n  end\n\n  %% styles\n  classDef in  fill:lightblue\n  classDef out fill:lightgreen\n  classDef fxn fill:yellow\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Flowchart of process for incorporating marine species sensitivities with distributions and generating a holistic vulnerability map.",

    "text": "(Jones and Cheung 2018)\nSuch vulnerability assessments recognize that a species’ vulnerability to climate change depends on an interaction between its intrinsic biological or ecological characteristics (sensitivity and adaptive capacity) and the extrinsic threats or stimuli (exposure and hazard) (Figure 1). In this study, we adopted the climate vulnerability and risk assessment framework used by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Field et al. (2014).\nSensitivity of a species, referred to here as the susceptibility to impacts from climate change, is affected by species’ biological and ecological traits. Species’ sensitivity may be moderated by their\nadaptive capacity, which reflects a species’ ability to adapt and thus cope with, or avoid, the impacts of climate change.\nAs the unit of assessment is an individual species, we consider a species’ ability to shift in distribution to avoid or minimize negative impacts from changing habitat conditions on its viability as an adaptive response to climate change. Specifically, in this study, we focus on characteristics that determine a species ability to show this response, within its current distribution. Thus, the spatial response of a distribution shift may itself be influenced by adaptive characteristics included here. The combination of a species’ sensitivity and (lack of) adaptive capacity determines its vulnerability to climate change. Ultimately, the risk of impacts of climate change on the species is determined by its vulnerability as well as the potential occurrence of climate-related ocean changes (i.e., hazards such as warming, ocean acidification) and the degree of exposure to such event (i.e., exposure) (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Framework for assessing climate change vulnerability and risk adopted by the fifth assessment report of the IPCC (Field et al., 2014)",

    "text": "(Zacharias and Gregr 2005)\n\nDefinitions of Sensitivity and Vulnerability\nSensitivity and vulnerability are central concepts in the protection of marine ecosystems, yet the marine literature provides few explicit definitions (Holt et al. 1997; Tyler-Walters & Jackson 1999). Consequently, their meaning often relies on the context in which they are used. To avoid context-dependent definitions of these terms, we took the following value-neutral approach to defining sensitivity and vulnerability.\nIt is axiomatic that all marine features have either evolved (in the case of biotic features) or been formed (in the case of abiotic features) within a certain range of environmental conditions. We define stress as a deviation of these environmental conditions beyond the expected range. Sensitivity is the degree to which marine features respond to such stress. Specifically, sensitivity is measured using one or more indicators (of species, communities, and habitats) that respond to one or more natural or anthropogenic stressors. These responses are potentially nonlinear and are likely to include interactions between stressors. In this context, sensitivity does not inherently assume the characteristics of fragility or intolerance with which it is often associated. There is no implied judgement that an increased association between the indicator and the stressor reduces a feature’s probability of persistence. Nevertheless, as exposure to a chronic perturbation or stress increases, the persistence of that feature is diminished.\nVulnerability is the probability that a feature will be exposed to a stressor to which it is sensitive. In other words, vulnerability is the likelihood of exposure to a relevant external stress factor (sensu Tyler-Walters & Jackson 1999), combined in some way with the exposure (duration, magnitude, rate of change) to that stress.\nSubsumed under the concepts of sensitivity and vulnerability are the concepts of stability and fragility. Although these terms lack general consensus on their definitions, Holling (1986) states that\nstability is the tendency of a system to attain or retain an equilibrium condition of steady state or stable oscillation.\nResilience is the ability of a system to maintain its structure and behavioral patterns when subjected to disturbance. A feature, therefore, that is stable or resilient in the presence of a stressor is not sensitive to that stress as we have defined it. Also, a feature that is sensitive to a stressor for which it has a low probability of exposure is not vulnerable.\nOur definitions of sensitivity and vulnerability are consistent with the ESI approach used for oil spill response and countermeasures (Gundlach & Hayes 1978). Under the ESI approach a resource is defined as sensitive to oil if it would be harmed by physical contact with oil or concentrations of oil in water. A resource is defined as vulnerable if it is likely that it would be exposed to oil or high concentrations of oil for long enough periods for the oil to affect it. Vulnerability in terms of oil spills on shorelines, therefore, is a function of duration of exposure, recognizing that certain resources are vulnerable to oiling regardless of duration.\nOur definition of a VMA, which incorporates the concepts of sensitivity and vulnerability, is a geographically definable area containing features that are sensitive to natural and/or anthropogenic stressors they are likely to encounter. Features may be biotic (species, communities) or abiotic (habitats) structures or processes.\nWe caution against equating VMAs as we have defined them (and their sensitivity and vulnerability components) with terms such as priority areas, biodiversity hotspots, critical habitat, environmental significance, and areas of interest, which are often used to identify areas of special concern or areas requiring management attention. Although certain VMAs may also represent priority areas or hotspots, depending on how these terms are defined and applied, an area may be sensitive or vulnerable but not meet criteria commonly used (e.g., species diversity) to identify these areas. In addition, although our definitions of sensitivity and vulnerability may contribute to measures or assessments of ecological (or ecosystem) integrity, these concepts are again different. Lastly, identification of an area as sensitive or vulnerable does not suggest that an area should be recommended as a marine protected area (MPA) or marine reserve or that MPAs are the only management tool applicable to the management and conservation of VMAs.",

The dimensions are used to calculate the species’ climate vulnerability (d), and the relative vulnerability scores are translated into absolute climate risk categories (e). f, Species maps are superimposed to assess the climate vulnerability and risk for marine ecosystems.

For example,\nsensitivity is analogous to the ecological concept of resistance,\nexposure is analogous to reactivity, and\nadaptivity is analogous to resilience (14–16).\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyce, Daniel G., Derek P.

    "text": "Interactive Applications\nWe have developed a series of interactive applications to explore the data and results of the MS project. These applications allow users to visualize the data, explore the results, and interact with the data in a more intuitive way. The applications are built using the shiny package in R, which allows us to easily create a user interface with complex reactivity for an interactive web application easily accessed through a web browser. The applications are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with interactive maps, charts, and tables that allow users to explore the data in a more dynamic way.\n\n\nOvercoming Challenges with Large Spatial Data\nThe MS project incorporates many large spatial datasets that are problematic to render in a typical interactive application. For instance, the most common interactive mapping R package leaflet has a 4MB limitation for displaying rasters (see “Large Raster Warning” in Raster Images • leaflet). Vectors (i.e., points, lines and polygons) get smoothed when containing many vertices, but contiguity gets lost between polygons and rendering degrades to non-usable depending on the internet speed of the user’s connection.\nTo work around these limitations, we have implemented “cloud native” web services and formats (see also Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide). Our implementations effectively reduce the size of any given spatial object based on the zoom level of the user’s browser. For rasters, we use cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and for vectors, we use Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). These formats are designed to be fast and efficient for web mapping applications, and they allow us to display large spatial datasets in an interactive web application without sacrificing performance or usability. Let’s take a closer look at implementation of each.\n\nRaster: Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler\nHistorically, to read a raster, such as a GeoTIFF, from the web, the client software would have to read the entire file before rendering. Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) take advantage of HTTP GET range requests to read only the part of the file needed for rendering. So a COG stores quadtree simplifications of the original raster at multiple zoom levels and metadata for accessing their byte ranges in the file in the metadata header. This allows the client software to request only the parts of the file needed for rendering, which can greatly reduce the amount of data transferred and speed up rendering. This is for accessing the raw data in pixel values, e.g., for a raster of species distribution then the abundance of a species in each cell. We would want to also apply a color ramp to visualize the data. The open-source (TiTiler software is a lightweight web service that serves up these color ramped tiles on the fly. So COGs can be stored on a simple file server (like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and served up as interactive web maps with TiTiler as an intermediary between the COG files and the client accessing the interactive Shiny mapping app (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Client      -&gt;&gt; ShinyServer: request Shiny map app with a raster layer\n  ShinyServer -&gt;&gt; Client:      return JavaScript (JS) with URL specification for raster tiles\n  loop for every tile in the current view (based on zoom level and bounding box)\n    Client     -&gt;&gt; TiTiler:    request specific raster tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    TiTiler    -&gt;&gt; FileServer: read metadata from COG file and request byte range for tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    FileServer -&gt;&gt; TiTiler:    send byte range for tile\n    TiTiler    -&gt;&gt; Client:     apply color ramp to tile and return PNG\n  end\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sequence diagram implementing large raster interactive display using Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Titiler in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVector: Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv\nAlthough “cloud native” vector formats exist for simple file storage (see Cloud-Optimized Geospatial Formats Guide), none of these allow for flexible filtering and manipulation. Instead, we use PostgreSQL with the spatial extension (PostGIS) to store the vector data and serve it as Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) using the pg_tileserv web service written in the language Go, which is very fast. This means that we don’t have to pre-render the MVTs (such as you might do with tippecanoe), but can instead serve the raw vector data directly from the database and let pg_tileserv handle the rendering on the fly. Filters (in the form of CQL) can be applied to the request. Symbology is rendered client-side via JavaScript, which allows for interactive hover and click events on vector objects (e.g., BOEM aliquot). Some speed-up is enabled by implementing a Varnish cache service in between. We can even write our own database functions for customized rendering, such as H3 hexagonal summaries. This allows us to serve vector data as web maps with minimal configuration and setup, and it provides a fast and efficient way to display large vector datasets in an interactive web application (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n  autonumber\n  Client        -&gt;&gt; ShinyServer: request Shiny map app with a vector layer\n  ShinyServer   -&gt;&gt; Client: return JavaScript (JS) with URL specification for vector tiles\n  loop for every tile in the current view (based on zoom level and bounding box)\n    Client      -&gt;&gt; VarnishCache: request specific vector tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n    alt cache hit\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; Client: return vector tile\n    else cache miss\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; pg_tileserv:  request specific vector tile ({z}/{x}/{y})\n      pg_tileserv  -&gt;&gt; pgDB:         run query to create vector tile in PostGIS database\n      pgDB         -&gt;&gt; pg_tileserv:  return vector tile in compressed Protobuf format (*.pbf)\n      pg_tileserv  -&gt;&gt; VarnishCache: store vector tile\n      VarnishCache -&gt;&gt; Client:       return vector tile\n    end\n  end\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sequence diagram implementing large vector interactive display using Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs) and pg_tileserv in a Shiny mapping app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub Repositories\n\n\n\n\n\nrepo\ndescription\n\n\n\n\napi\napplication programming interface (API) using R Plumber package\n\n\napps\nShiny applications\n\n\ndocs\ndocumentation for BOEM’s offshore environmental sensitivity index products\n\n\nmanuscripts\nManuscripts with review of sensitivities by industry and receptors (species, habitats, human uses)\n\n\nMarineSensitivity.github.io\ndefault website\n\n\nmsens\nR library of functions for mapping marine sensitivities, sponsored by BOEM\n\n\nobjectives\nrepository for issues spanning multiple repositories and doing big picture roadmapping\n\n\nserver\nserver setup for R Shiny apps, RStudio IDE, R Plumber API, PostGIS database, pg_tileserv\n\n\nworkflows\nscripts for testing data analytics and visualization as well as production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIs\n\n\napplication programming interfaces (APIs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps\n\n\ninteractive applications using Shiny\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nPostgreSQL database extended spatially with PostGIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocs\n\n\ntechnical documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\n\n\ndocumented functions as an R package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServer\n\n\nserver software configuration using Docker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows\n\n\nscripts for exploring plus production workflows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items",
