## Table and Column Naming Conventions

- Table names are plural and use all lower case.
- Unique identifiers are suffixed with:
  - `*_id` for unique integer keys;
  - `*_key` for unique string keys;
  - `*_seq` for auto-incrementing sequence integer keys.
- Column names are singular and use snake_case.
- Foreign keys are named with the singular form of the table they reference, followed by _id.
- Primary keys are named id.
