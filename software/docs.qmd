Technical documentation is principally in this book:

- [marinesensitivity.org/docs](https://marinesensitivity.org/workflows/)\
  the main documentation site

- [github.com/MarineSensitivity/docs](https://github.com/MarineSensitivity/workflows)\
  source code in the Github repository

But there are also some other self-documenting resources:

- [marinesensitivity.org/`msens`](https://marinesensitivity.org/faq/)\
  documented R functions
