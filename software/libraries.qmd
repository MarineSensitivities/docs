By creating an R package, we can document functions and make them easily available to other users. 

- [`msens`](https://github.com/MarineSensitivity/msens)\
  R library of functions for mapping marine sensitivities, sponsored by BOEM

Functions can _**read**_ data from the one [APIs](api.qmd) (which communicate with the [Database](db.qmd)), _**analyze**_ the data, _**visualize**_ the results and store some smaller _**data**_.
